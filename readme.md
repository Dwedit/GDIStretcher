# GDIStretcher
GDIStretcher is a program that allows you to run 2D Windows Games (games which do not use DirectX) with a stretchable window, and will use high-quality SuperXBR filtering to enlarge the graphics.

Normally, older games that use GDI will run in a fixed-size window, and are intended for smaller screen sizes such as 640x480 or 800x600, as opposed to modern common 1920x1080 resolution displays.  The window is usually not resizable.  This tool will allow you to resize and maximize the window.
